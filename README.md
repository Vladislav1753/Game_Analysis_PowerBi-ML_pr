# 🎮 Gaming Behavior Analysis and Dashboard

## 📊 Introduction
This project explores player behavior in a gaming dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python and a dynamic interactive dashboard built in Power BI. The goal is to better understand the demographics, preferences, and engagement levels of players based on gameplay, session activity, and in-game purchases.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Data Source**: A synthetic dataset of 40,000 players containing attributes like age, gender, location, game genre, session statistics, and engagement.
- **EDA and ML (Python)**: Conducted using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to explore:
  - Player demographics
  - Session activity patterns
  - Relationships between engagement level, play time, and player attributes
  - Models  training 
- **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive report visualizing:
  - Key metrics (avg. age, session time, etc.)
  - Genre preferences by gender
  - Regional distribution of players
  - Engagement levels and player types

## 🚀 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `predicting-gaming-behaviour-and-eda.ipynb`: Python notebook with full EDA and ML models.
- Power BI report (dashboard in `.pbix` file).
- Dataset.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can uncover meaningful trends in gaming behavior. The combination of Python and Power BI allows both deep-dive analysis and business-level storytelling for stakeholders.
